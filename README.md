# Freedom of Insomnia
Completely server-side mod for Fabric that allows players to disable phantom spawning (doInsomnia) individually a.k.a. per-player phantom spawning. This means that one player can farm phantom membranes on a server while another player can live their life unbothered by them. By default, however, phantoms are enabled for everyone.

Usage:
- `/insomnia` - informs whether insomnia is enabled for you
- `/insomnia toggle` - toggles insomnia on or off

NOTE: This mod requires the Fabric API.
